Scribe[<sup>1</sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scribe) is a community of language enthusiasts, learners and developers creating tools to help people communicate with confidence.

Our current project is [Scribe-iOS](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS), a pack of iOS and iPadOS keyboards with features including translation, verb conjugation and word annotation. Later focus will shift to [Scribe-Android](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Android) and [Scribe-Desktop](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Desktop).

We strive to be an inclusive community[<sup>2</sup>](https://github.com/scribe-org/Organization/blob/main/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Be it the software we write or the language data from [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) that it's based on, coders and open-source supporters of any level are welcome!

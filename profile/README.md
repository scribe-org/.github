## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Scribe[<sup>1</sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scribe) is a community of language enthusiasts, learners and developers creating tools to help people communicate with confidence. Our current project is [Scribe-iOS](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS), a pack of iOS and iPadOS keyboards with features including translation, verb conjugation and word annotation. Creating an MVP for [Scribe-Android](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Android) is now a focus, and [Scribe-Desktop](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Desktop) will follow.

We strive to be an inclusive community. Be it the software we write or the language data from [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) that it's based on, coders and open-source supporters of any level are welcome!
